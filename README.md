3d crane control programme

The main goal of the project is to automate the 3D crane to change the position of small, magnetic blocks. 3d crane has reflective sensor on the actuator and magnes to catch those blocks and change its position.

The PLC program was created in TIA Portal V15.1. PLCs S7-1200 from Siemens were used to accomplish the project.
